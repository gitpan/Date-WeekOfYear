Date/WeekOfYear version 0.01
============================

Date::WeekOfYear is small and efficient. 
The only purpose is to return the week of the year. 
This can be called in either a scalar or list context.

As from version 1.5 the returned week and year are based
in ISO 8601.  The previous functionality can be accessed by
passing a second, true argment.

In a scalar context, just the week number is returned (the year starts at 
week 1).

In a list context, both the week number and the year (YYYY) are returned. 
This ensures that you know which year the week number relates too. 
This is only an issue in the week where the year changes (ie depending on 
the day you can be in either week 52, 53 or week 1.
